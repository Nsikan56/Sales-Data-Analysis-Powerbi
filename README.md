# Sales Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project showcases an end-to-end sales analytics solution using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

The original dataset only included December transactions, so I simulated full-year data (Jan–Dec) using Python to enable seasonality and trend analysis. I then used SQL for customer segmentation, sales aggregation, and data preparation before loading into Power BI for visualization.

## 🔍 Key Features
- KPI cards: Total Sales, Quantity, Transactions, Unique Customers  
- Monthly sales trend (line chart)  
- Top 10 products by revenue (bar chart)  
- Country-wise sales breakdown (donut chart)  
- Customer lifetime value table  
- Interactive slicers for country and month

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas)
- SQL (joins, aggregation)
- Power BI (DAX, slicers, visuals)

## 📁 Files Included
- `Sales_Dashboard.pbix` — Power BI dashboard
- `Simulated_Full_Year_OnlineRetail_2023.csv` — cleaned dataset
